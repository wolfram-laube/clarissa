    Note over E: Voice input from field tablet
    E->>C: "I need a waterflood model, 5-spot pattern, 40 acre spacing"
    C->>C: Parse intent (confidence: 0.92)
    C->>E: "What's the reservoir depth and initial pressure?"
    E->>C: "8,500 ft TVD, about 3,800 psi"
    C->>V: Validate pressure gradient
    V-->>C: 0.45 psi/ft plausible
    C->>C: Generate ECLIPSE deck
    C->>E: "I've assumed 200 md permeability from Permian Basin analogs. Confirm or adjust?"
    E->>C: "Use 150 md, we have core data"
    Note over C: Update deck, log assumption override
    C->>S: Execute simulation
    S-->>C: Results + convergence data
    C->>E: "Simulation complete. Water breakthrough at 18 months."
