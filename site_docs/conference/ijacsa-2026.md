## Abstract

Reservoir simulation remains one of the most technically demanding disciplines in the energy sector. Despite decades of software evolution, the fundamental barrier persists: translating engineering intent into executable simulation input requires specialized expertise that takes years to develop.

This paper presents the architecture of CLARISSA (Conversational Language Agent for Reservoir Integrated Simulation System Analysis), a system designed to bridge the gap between natural language interaction and domain-specific simulation syntax.

We propose a multi-stage pipeline that decomposes translation into discrete, validated steps: speech recognition, intent classification, entity extraction, asset validation, syntax generation, and physics-based verification.

The architecture addresses deployment heterogeneity through configuration-driven design, enabling air-gapped installations alongside cloud-native deployments.
