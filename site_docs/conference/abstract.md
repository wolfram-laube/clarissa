# CLARISSA Abstract

**Conversational Language Agent for Reservoir Integrated Simulation System Analysis**

---

## Full Abstract

CLARISSA is a phased AI agent architecture designed to augment reservoir simulation workflows through simulator-in-the-loop learning, physics-centric reasoning, and governed human interaction.

Rather than replacing established simulators, CLARISSA integrates multiple reservoir simulators as heterogeneous sources of numerical and physical feedback, complemented by a lightweight native simulation kernel for controlled experiments, sensitivity analysis, and explainability.

### Components

**Large Language Models** provide:

- Planning and reasoning
- Human-oriented interaction
- Natural language understanding

**Reinforcement Learning** optimizes:

- Action sequences (debugging, model refinement)
- Based on simulator-derived numerical outcomes
- Including convergence behavior and stability

**Neuro-symbolic Governance** enforces:

- Engineering rules and constraints
- Escalation policies
- Safety boundaries

### Evolution Path

```
Phase 1: Syntactic Assistance
    ↓
Phase 2: Physics-Informed Support
    ↓
Phase 3: Field-Specialized Agents
```

CLARISSA evolves from syntactic assistance toward physics-informed reservoir engineering support and, ultimately, field-specialized agents embedded in operational teams.
