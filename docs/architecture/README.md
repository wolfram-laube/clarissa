# Architecture diagrams

Mermaid sources live in `docs/architecture/diagrams/*.mmd`.

CI job `architecture_graphs` renders these into SVGs under `docs/architecture/rendered/`.

!!! tip "Source files"
    If diagrams don't render above, the `.mmd` sources in `diagrams/` are the canonical truth.
    You can view them in any Mermaid-compatible editor.
