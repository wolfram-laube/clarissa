[clarissa] starting demo with deck:
 -- minimal deck (mock)
well a rate 100

[clarissa<path> proposal: reduce well a rate from 100 to 90 to improve stability
[gov] auto-approve enabled (auto_approve=1).
[clarissa] applying change and running simulator...
[sim] outcome: {'ran': true, 'converged': true, 'timestep_collapses': 0, 'errors': []}
[clarissa<path> explanation: simulation stabilized after rate reduction; no divergence flags were observed.
